Welcome to Python for All!

This is the official repository for our "Python for All" course, where you'll discover the beauty of Python, one of the most versatile and powerful programming languages. This course has something for everyone.

Inside this repository, you'll find presentations and code worked on during the course. You'll also find exercises and projects to help you practice and apply what you've learned.
